The analysis focuses on trust companystock prices (quoted in  percentage of parvalue), computed as the midpoint of the bid and ask quotations for individual trusts, which we hand entered from the “Trust and Surety Company” table published three times per week in the New York Tribune.

We classify trusts according to their connections to major to four major “moneytrust”, including  1) JP Morgan, 2) First National Bank of New York, 3) National City Bank of New York, and 4) NationalBank of Commerce of New York. The connections are taken from the Pujo report [3].
